# dotfiles

> User-specific application configuration is traditionally stored in so called dotfiles (files whose filename starts
> with a dot). It is common practice to track dotfiles with a version control system such as Git to keep track of
> changes
> and synchronize dotfiles across various hosts. There are various approaches to managing your dotfiles (e.g. directly
> tracking dotfiles in the home directory v.s. storing them in a subdirectory and symlinking/copying/generating files
> with
> a shell script or a dedicated tool). Apart from explaining how to manage your dotfiles this article also contains a
> list
> of dotfile repositories from Arch Linux users.
